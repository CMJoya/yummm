    taco.method = <<-EORECIPE
    Mix masa harina, water and salt together until it forms into a soft ball. If itâ€™s too dry, add a bit more water a tablespoon at a time.
    Divide dough into 16 equal balls, and press out with a tortilla press or roll out with a rolling pin.
    Keep pressed discs covered with a damp cloth.
    Heat up two inches of oil in a pot or skillet to 350 degrees.
    Gently place a disc in the hot oil and it should immediately start to puff. After five seconds, with a spatula, make an indention in the center so it forms a V shape.
    Gently cook the shell on each side until light brown and crispy (about 20 seconds for each side).
    Remove from oil and drain on a paper towel.
    Stuff with spicy ground beef, shredded iceberg lettuce, diced tomatoes, grated cheddar and salsa and serve immediately.
    Makes 16 tacos.
